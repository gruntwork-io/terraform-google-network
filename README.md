## How is this Module versioned?

This Module follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). You can find each new release, along
with the changelog, in the [Releases Page](../../releases).

During initial development, the major version will be 0 (e.g., `0.x.y`), which indicates the code does not yet have a
stable API. Once we hit `1.0.0`, we will make every effort to maintain a backwards compatible API and use the MAJOR,
MINOR, and PATCH versions on each release to indicate any incompatibilities.
